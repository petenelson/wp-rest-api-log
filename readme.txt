== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use ElasticPress logging? =

[ElasticPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elasticpress/) is a plugin than interfaces WordPress to the [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) search service.  Because ElasticSearch has its own REST API for indexing and searching data, it was a natural fit to extend logging support via this REST API Logging plugin.

You can go into Settings > ElasticPress to enable logging for requests & responses.  You can also disable REST API logging if you only need ElasticPress logging.
